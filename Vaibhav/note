'''Certainly! Let's use the provided values \( L = 463 \) and the primer length range from the code \( \text{primer\_length\_range} = \{18, 19, 20, 21, 22\} \) to calculate the total number of possible primer sequences.

For each primer length \( l \) in the range from 18 to 22, we'll calculate the number of possible starting positions within the mRNA sequence using the formula \( N = L - l + 1 \). Then, we'll sum up these counts to find the total number of possible primer sequences.

Let's calculate it:

For \( l = 18 \):
\[ N_{18} = L - 18 + 1 = 463 - 18 + 1 = 446 \]

For \( l = 19 \):
\[ N_{19} = L - 19 + 1 = 463 - 19 + 1 = 445 \]

For \( l = 20 \):
\[ N_{20} = L - 20 + 1 = 463 - 20 + 1 = 444 \]

For \( l = 21 \):
\[ N_{21} = L - 21 + 1 = 463 - 21 + 1 = 443 \]

For \( l = 22 \):
\[ N_{22} = L - 22 + 1 = 463 - 22 + 1 = 442 \]

Now, let's sum up these counts to find the total number of possible primer sequences:
\[ \text{Total possible primer sequences} = N_{18} + N_{19} + N_{20} + N_{21} + N_{22} \]
\[ = 446 + 445 + 444 + 443 + 442 = 2220 \]

So, with an mRNA sequence of length 463 and considering primer lengths ranging from 18 to 22, we have a total of 2220 possible primer sequences. This calculation aligns with the result obtained from the code, which was 2219 due to an off-by-one error in the indexing.'''
